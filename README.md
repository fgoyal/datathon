# 2019 Illini Statistics Datathon

## Description
In the Illini Statistics Club's 2nd annual Datathon, participants will work in teams and be presented a large, complex dataset. They will have 36 hours to apply their quantitative skills to analyze the dataset and tackle an industry problem. Though the competition is the core event of the Datathon, there will also be fun workshops presented from professionals in the field and a chance to talk to corporate sponsors. So come learn how to apply analytical skills learned in the classroom to real-life data!
